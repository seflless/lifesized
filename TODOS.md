### Todos
  - Add Windows/Linux native support
  - Make sure that the module works in the main process just as well as in a render process.
  - Propose Electron add this to it's core
    - Already did this, but will push again when I have a better example/use-case to really sell it
  - Read these:
    - http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.33.0/api/screen/#screen-getalldisplays
    - http://stackoverflow.com/a/12589799
  - Make sure of the following:
    - Think about fallbacks when not on macs?
      - Return the usual default of 72?
      - Return something representing unavailable like null?
    - Detect and throw exception when in the incorrect environment:
      - node.js
      - Electron's main process
    - Provide APIs for
      - Getting the DPI
      - Getting the size of a display in inches (function defaults to the current window's 'screen', a screen can be provided to find the correct one)
      - Getting the size of the browser window in inches
      - Ensure there are events to communicate a change ppi
        - Wait, PPI can't change, just the display that the browserwindow is over,
          perhaps instead just documenting that users should use the built-in event for changes to the display
          - hmmmm, seems there is no such event. We'll have to rig it up by figuring it out ourselves. Hopefully we can figure out which window the window is in
